        "\n",
        "The paper \"Tidy Data\" by Wickham addresses the principles and practices of proper data organization to allow for a more effective data analysis process. Wickham argues that while cleaning data is needed for proper data analysis, this step lacks attention to detail and following defined data standards can help simplify this process. Wickham dives into the common problems with disorganized and messy data and proposes solution on how to clean it.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"tidy data standard\" seeks to streamline the process of data cleaning and organization by following a defined list of guidelines. The purpose is to make cleaning data simplier through the defined process and format of each variable being represented by a column, each observation by a row, and each type of observational unit by a seperate table. This defined framework would eliminate any ambiguity in the data clearing process and ensure that the data can be analysed effectively.\n",

        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The message trying to be conveyed is that datasets share a uniform structure and follow similar characteristics. This allows users to be familiar with the approach when working with them. But messay data presents challenges that can cause disorganization. The second sentence focuses on this more and states how identifying variables are straightforward but difficulty can arise if the structure of the data isn't clean and thus can't apply the same techniques to all datasets if not cleaned.\n",

        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?"
